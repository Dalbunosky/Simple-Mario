# Simple Mario

A remake of the Jumping Dinosaur game that exist on Google Chrome pages whenever the host computer is unable to connect to the internet and the page fails to load. Instead of a Dinosaur jumping to avoid running into cacti, a clone of Mario from the game Super Mario is made to avoid speeding cacti and mushrooms by jumping. Mario stays at the left of the screen, and its obstacles run across towards Mario.

# Features

### Obstacles 

There are current two obstacles in the game, the mushroom and the cactus. There can be up to 4 mushrooms present, and each runs across the screen at its own speed. The cactus runs at a speed that is relative to the width of the box that the game is set in, and thus will reach Mario at a steady interval.

### Jumping mechanism 

To have Mario jump, you can either click anywhere on the window besides the restart button, or by using the space bar, no matter when during the game, for the first jump or not.

### Restart mechanism 

The start button that exist at the beginning on the game becomes the restart button when you first play. Whether your current game has ended or not, pressing the restart button will trigger a score check, and restarting of the game.

### Scoring mechanism 

The game has a running clock and score count that respectively record the endurance of the current running game as well as the score. It also records the high score overall of every game you've played since loading the page. The high score will only be recorded and changed when a game ends and a score check is done. If there is a tie in score, the longer game will be kept.

# Future features

### Luigi upgrade/downgrade

There are current two obstacles in the game, a third object could be added to game that if Mario decides to contact, will turn into Luigi, who would change back into Mario upon contact with a mushroom or the cactus, and the game would continue.

### Mushroom defeating mechanism 

If Mario/Luigi jumps and lands on top of a mushroom, the mushroom can be deemed defeated instead of Mario. In such a case, Mario/Luigi's score will increase by a different amount than by jumping and missing the mushroom as it passed. This feature would not be given to the cactus. No one likes to land on a spiny cactus.

### A single sun 

The current background will display several suns if the game box goes over the length of the background. The background should be edited to remove the Sun, with a single Sun image placed instead on top of the background, giving a scenario that is closer to reality.
